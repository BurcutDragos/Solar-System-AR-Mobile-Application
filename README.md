# Solar-System-AR-Mobile-Application
 This Augmented Reality Android application is an interactive application developed with Unity that allows users to explore the solar system in an engaging and educational manner. Each celestial body is meticulously represented, offering both visual and auditory information specific to each.

 ## 📱 Key Features:
- **Interactive Exploration**: Navigate through dedicated scenes for each celestial body in the solar system. Realistic planetary textures and rotations.
- **Detailed Information**: Each planet and satellite comes with an informative description presented in an accessible format.
- **Audio Experience**: Listen to unique sounds associated with each celestial body, with the option to toggle the sound on or off using a "Mute/Unmute" button.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Dedicated buttons for navigation and sound control, seamlessly integrated into each scene.

## ✅ Project Structure:

This repository includes:
- `Assets/` — Main source files (scripts, scenes, textures, prefabs, audio files)
- `Packages/` — Package manifest for Unity dependencies
- `ProjectSettings/` — Configuration for the Unity project
- `README.md` — This documentation file
- `LICENSE` — Project license
- `Solar_System_Mobile_AR_Application.apk` — A pre-built APK to test the app on Android devices

## ❌ Not Included (Git-Ignored):

According to the `.gitignore` file, the following folders/files are excluded and **not uploaded** to GitHub:
- `Library/`, `Logs/`, `obj/`, `Temp/`, `.vs/`, `.utmp/`, `UserSettings/` — These are Unity or system-specific temporary/generated folders.
- Any local build cache, compiled binaries, or intermediate files
- Local `.csproj` or `.sln` build environment artifacts

These are either auto-generated by Unity or specific to your development machine.

## 🚀 How to Open and Run the Project Locally:

To successfully open and build this project on your machine, follow the steps below:

### 1. Prerequisites:

- **Unity Hub** and **Unity 6**
- **AR Foundation** + **ARCore XR Plugin** (Install via Unity Package Manager)
- **TextMeshPro Essentials** (Unity will prompt you to import it on first open)
- **Android Build Support** (via Unity Hub)
- **An integrated development environment that also supports working with the C# programming language for script files** (Microsoft Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, etc.)

> 📌 You must also install the same Unity version used in this project for full compatibility.

### 2. Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/BurcutDragos/Solar-System-AR-Mobile-Application.git

### 3. Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd "Solar System AR Mobile Application"

### 4. Open the Project in Unity:
Open Unity Hub > Add Project > Select the folder where you cloned the repository.

### 5. Let Unity Regenerate Missing Files
Unity will automatically recreate the missing folders (like Library/) and recompile the scripts. Accept any package installation prompts (e.g., for TextMeshPro).

### 6. Build and Run on Android
- Switch to Android Platform (File > Build Settings)
- Connect your Android device via USB with Developer Mode enabled
- Click Build and Run

Alternatively, install the provided Solar_System_Mobile_AR_Application.apk onto your Android device to test it immediately.

## 🧠 Notes:
- Make sure your device supports **ARCore**.
- Audio levels are managed using Unity’s **Audio Mixer** for clarity.
- Some visual or performance tweaks may depend on the device used.
